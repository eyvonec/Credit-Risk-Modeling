# Credit Risk Modeling

## Overview
This project implements advanced credit risk modeling techniques using a dataset from Kaggle. It showcases the development of stacked models, both unbalanced and balanced, to address the challenges of credit risk assessment.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Risk Dataset from Kaggle:
[Credit Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset/code)

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Creation of specialized ensemble models
- Implementation of stacked models
- Handling of imbalanced data using SMOTE
- Cross-validation techniques for model evaluation
- Development of risk strategy tables

## Models Implemented
1. Unbalanced Stacked Model
2. Balanced Stacked Model

## Results
The project provides comprehensive risk strategy tables that offer insights into:
- Acceptance rates
- Bad rates
- Portfolio values
- Expected losses

These results allow for informed decision-making in credit risk management.

## Usage
1. Load the Kaggle Credit Risk Dataset
2. Run the preprocessing scripts
3. Execute the model training scripts
4. Generate and analyze the risk strategy tables

## Future Work
- Fine-tuning of model hyperparameters
- Exploration of additional feature engineering techniques
- Integration with a web application for real-time credit scoring
